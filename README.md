Python IDE based on Kumir-2

You should install kumir2 libs and devel package from your distro's RPM or from this repo: [https://github.com/victor-yacovlev/kumir2].

Then setup `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` variable to location, where file `Kumir2/Kumir2Config.cmake` exists. By default, it is 
`/usr/lib64/cmake` for most distros.
